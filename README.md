A simplified Paytm clone â€” my first major project, created during Harkirat Singh's Cohort-2, with frontend developed independently

This project acts as a basic simulation of a payment application, allowing users to transfer money to one another.
It features authentication via JWTs and uses MongoDB for handling transactions.
The app includes user registration and login, displays a list of users, and supports simulated money transfers between accounts.
